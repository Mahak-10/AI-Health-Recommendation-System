AI Health Recommendation System

An advanced AI-powered health recommendation platform that provides personalized health insights. Built with Spring Boot microservices, Spring Cloud, Eureka Service Discovery, RabbitMQ, and Keycloak, this system leverages the Gemini API to generate accurate health suggestions based on user-provided health metrics.


Architecture & Technologies

The system consists of 6 microservices:

Eureka Server â€“ Service registry for discovering all microservices.
Config Server â€“ Centralized configuration management for all services.
API Gateway â€“ Routes requests and handles authentication via Keycloak.
User Service â€“ Registers and manages users.
Activity Service â€“ Handles activities posted by registered users.
AI Recommendation Service â€“ Receives health metrics from users, sends structured prompts to Gemini API, receives AI-generated recommendations, and stores them.


Additional Components & Technologies:

RabbitMQ â€“ Asynchronous communication between services.
Spring Cloud â€“ Service discovery, configuration, and routing.
Keycloak â€“ Authentication & role-based access control.
PostgreSQL & MongoDB â€“ Persistent data storage.
Gemini API â€“ AI-powered health recommendation engine.


Features

ðŸ”¹ Personalized Health Recommendations â€“ Based on metrics like calories burned, heart rate, blood pressure, and activity type.
ðŸ”¹ Activity Management â€“ Users can post and track their health-related activities.
ðŸ”¹ AI-Powered Insights â€“ Gemini API provides recommendations in a predefined prompt format.
ðŸ”¹ Microservices Architecture â€“ Each service is independent, scalable, and maintainable.
ðŸ”¹ Asynchronous Communication â€“ RabbitMQ ensures smooth, decoupled operations.
ðŸ”¹ Secure User Management â€“ Keycloak handles authentication and authorization.
ðŸ”¹ Persistent Storage â€“ Ensures reliable storage of user data, activities, and AI recommendations.


How It Works

User Registration & Authentication â€“ Users register via User Service; authentication handled through Keycloak.
Activity Posting â€“ Users post activities via Activity Service.
Health Metric Submission â€“ Metrics like calories burned, heart rate, blood pressure, and activity type are sent to AI Recommendation Service.
Asynchronous Processing â€“ Data is sent through RabbitMQ to the AI service.
AI Recommendation Generation â€“ AI Service formats the prompt for Gemini API, receives recommendations, and stores them.
Response Delivery â€“ Recommendations are returned to users via API Gateway.


Security

Keycloak Integration â€“ Role-based access control and secure authentication.
JWT Tokens â€“ Used for service-to-service communication and user sessions.


Future Enhancements

Real-time dashboards for user health metrics.
Predictive analytics for early detection of potential health risks.
Integration with wearable devices for automated data collection.
