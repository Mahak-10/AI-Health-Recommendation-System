# **AI Health Recommendation System**

An advanced **AI-powered health recommendation platform** that provides personalized health insights.  
Built with **Spring Boot microservices, Spring Cloud, Eureka Service Discovery, RabbitMQ, and Keycloak**, this system leverages the **Gemini API** to generate accurate health suggestions based on user-provided health metrics.

## **1. Architecture & Technologies**

The system consists of **6 microservices**:

1. **Eureka Server** â€“ Service registry for discovering all microservices.  
2. **Config Server** â€“ Centralized configuration management for all services.  
3. **API Gateway** â€“ Routes requests and handles authentication via Keycloak.  
4. **User Service** â€“ Registers and manages users.  
5. **Activity Service** â€“ Handles activities posted by registered users.  
6. **AI Recommendation Service** â€“ Receives health metrics from users, sends structured prompts to Gemini API, receives AI-generated recommendations, and stores them.  

### **Additional Components & Technologies:**
- **RabbitMQ** â€“ Asynchronous communication between services.  
- **Spring Cloud** â€“ Service discovery, configuration, and routing.  
- **Keycloak** â€“ Authentication & role-based access control.  
- **PostgreSQL & MongoDB** â€“ Persistent data storage.  
- **Gemini API** â€“ AI-powered health recommendation engine.

## **2. Features**

- ðŸ”¹ **Personalized Health Recommendations** â€“ Based on metrics like calories burned, heart rate, blood pressure, and activity type.  
- ðŸ”¹ **Activity Management** â€“ Users can post and track their health-related activities.  
- ðŸ”¹ **AI-Powered Insights** â€“ Gemini API provides recommendations in a predefined prompt format.  
- ðŸ”¹ **Microservices Architecture** â€“ Each service is independent, scalable, and maintainable.  
- ðŸ”¹ **Asynchronous Communication** â€“ RabbitMQ ensures smooth, decoupled operations.  
- ðŸ”¹ **Secure User Management** â€“ Keycloak handles authentication and authorization.  
- ðŸ”¹ **Persistent Storage** â€“ Ensures reliable storage of user data, activities, and AI recommendations.

## **3. How It Works**

1. **User Registration & Authentication** â€“ Users register via User Service; authentication handled through Keycloak.  
2. **Activity Posting** â€“ Users post activities via Activity Service.  
3. **Health Metric Submission** â€“ Metrics like calories burned, heart rate, blood pressure, and activity type are sent to AI Recommendation Service.  
4. **Asynchronous Processing** â€“ Data is sent through RabbitMQ to the AI service.  
5. **AI Recommendation Generation** â€“ AI Service formats the prompt for Gemini API, receives recommendations, and stores them.  
6. **Response Delivery** â€“ Recommendations are returned to users via API Gateway.

## **4. Security**

- **Keycloak Integration** â€“ Role-based access control and secure authentication.  
- **JWT Tokens** â€“ Used for service-to-service communication and user sessions.
